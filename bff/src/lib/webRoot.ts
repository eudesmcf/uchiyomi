// Serve the web app from the API process, when they are packaged together.

// This exists to answer a fair question: everyone else ships one container. Komga is one (Spring serves its
// own Angular build), Kavita is one, Jellyfin is one, every *arr is one. A separate nginx purely to hand out
// static files is unusual for this class of app, and it is the topology that produced the port-dropping
// redirect that broke every deep link on the documented default port.
//
// It is OPT-IN and additive: with WEB_ROOT unset this module does nothing at all, and the two-container
// setup behaves exactly as before. One code path, chosen by whether the files are there.
//
// Everything below has an nginx.conf line it is replacing. Where the behaviour differs the comment says so,
// because "we moved the static server" is only safe if the headers came with it.
