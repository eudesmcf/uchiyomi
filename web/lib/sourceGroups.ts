// This used to also group sources by declared language and render a chip per language. That is gone. The
// grouping was the trigger for a stall -- switching group mid-load left the wall counting sources it had
// forgotten, so its skeletons never resolved -- and thrashing the chips fired abandoned scrapes that each
// cost the server a full timeout and then wrote a multi-minute cooldown against the source. Ranking survived
// the removal because ranking was the useful half.
