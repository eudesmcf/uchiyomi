 * and never asks), so on a shared device the next person to sign in could open the previous person's
 * downloads by navigating to those book ids, with `visible()` never consulted and the age cap and library
 * grants both bypassed. That is the same hole the v0.11.0 sign-out purge closed for cached API responses,
 * left open on the larger and more permanent store beside it.

 * Opening this database must never be able to hang, and v0.11.1 proved why.

 * An IndexedDB version change waits for every OTHER open connection to close first. The service worker held
 * one (it opened `yomi-offline` for the outbox flush and never closed it), so the page's v1 to v2 upgrade
 * fired `blocked` and, with no handler, the promise never settled. `loadChapter` awaits the offline lookup
 * before it does anything else, so the reader sat on "Loading chapter..." forever, for every chapter, for
 * anyone who already had the old database. A fresh browser creates v2 directly and never blocks, which is
 * exactly why the browser end-to-end pass did not catch it.
 *
 * Two defences, because either alone is thin. `blocked` gives up rather than waiting, and the deadline makes
 * "the store is unavailable" a bounded answer rather than a state the app can wait in.
